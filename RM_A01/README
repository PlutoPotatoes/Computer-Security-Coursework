Hours invested: 3 on problems 1,2,3, and 5, 3 hours on problem 4

All functions implemented as intended (Hopefully) with the exception of the english similarity scoring function. 
Instead of lowest mean-square error I chose to represent english as a character probability vector.
Using this vector I then compared the character probability of text samples using cosine similarity.

All functions work except 4. It is able to iterate through the lines and run the crack_single_byte_xor for each.
However, I was unable to find the hidden message.
